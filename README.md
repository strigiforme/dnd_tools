# Howard's dnd_tools
Some organizational tools for my dungeons and dragons 5e campaign

# Questions?

## Why?
Mostly to practice my PHP skills. I'd like to use node.js but I really don't have the time to learn that at the moment

## Can I help?
Sure, I'm picky though, I may ask for a lot of changes before accepting any PR's

## What kind of tools?
I'm looking to have the following features
 - Character Sheet tracker
 - Dice Roller
 - NPC list
 - Maps
 - Spells
 - Homebrew content
 - Spell List
 - Magic item list / Treasury
